 Standard automatic speech recognizers output unstructured streams words,0
" They neither perform proper segmentation output sentences, predict punctuation symbols",0
" The unavailable punctuations sentence boundaries transcribed speech texts create barriers many subsequent processing tasks, summarization, information extraction, question answering machine translation",0
" Thus, segmentation long texts necessary many real applications",0
" For example, speech-to-speech translation, continuously transcribed speech texts need segmented fed subsequent machine translation systems (Takezawa et al",0

" This current machine translation (MT) systems perform translation sentence level, various models used MT trained segmented sentences many algorithms inside MT exponential complexity regard length inputs",0
 The punctuation prediction problem attracted research interest speech processing community natural language processing community,0
" Most previous work primarily exploits local features statistical models lexicons, prosodic cues hidden event language model (HELM) (Liu et al",0
", 2005; Matusov et al",0
", 2006; Huang Zweig, 2002; Stolcke Shriberg, 1996)",0
 The word-level models integrating local features narrow views input could achieve satisfied performance due limited context information access (Favre et al,0
", 2008)",0
" Naturally, global contexts required model punctuation prediction, especially long-range dependencies",0
"For instance, English question sentences, ending question mark long-range dependent initial phrases (Lu Ng, 2010), could Figure 1",0
 There work trying incorporate syntactic features broaden view hypotheses punctuation prediction models (Roark et al,0
", 2006; Favre et al",0
", 2008)",0
" In methods, punctuation prediction treated separated post-procedure parsing, may suffer problem error propagation",0
" In addition, approaches able incrementally process inputs efficient long inputs, especially cases long transcribed speech texts presentations number streaming words could larger hundreds thousands",0
" In paper, propose jointly performing punctuation prediction transition-based dependency parsing transcribed speech text",0
" When transition-based parsing consumes stream words left right shift-reduce decoding algorithm, punctuation symbols predicted word based contexts parsing tree",0
 Two models proposed cause punctuation prediction interact transition actions parsing,0
 One conduct transition actions parsing followed punctuation predictions cascaded way,0
" The associate conventional transition actions parsing punctuation perditions, predicted punctuations directly inferred parsing tree",0
 Our models linear complexity capable handling streams words length,0
" In addition, computation models use rich set syntactic features, improve complicated punctuation predictions global view, especially long range dependencies",0
Figure 1 shows example parsing helps punctuation prediction transcribed speech text,0
"As illustrated Figure 1(b), two commas predicted preceding words act adverbial modifiers (advmod) parsing",0
